# Brain-Stroke-detection-using-yolov11

This project presents a deep learning-based binary classification model to detect and differentiate between Hemoragik and Iskemik stroke types from medical brain images. The model is trained and evaluated on a curated dataset consisting of 1842 images, distributed across:

Training set: 1289 images

Validation set: 368 images

Test set: 185 images

The model architecture is designed to work with grayscale or RGB brain scans and leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for efficient feature extraction and classification. Preprocessing steps such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation are applied to enhance model robustness.

This implementation aims to support clinical decision-making by providing rapid and reliable classification of stroke types, potentially reducing diagnosis time and enabling early intervention.
